[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Each release is a `vX.Y.Z` tag; CI
builds the extension and one bundle per platform from that tag.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- One-command install: `curl -fsSL https://klammr.github.io/klammr/install.sh | sh` (Linux, macOS) or `irm https://klammr.github.io/klammr/install.ps1 | iex` (Windows PowerShell) downloads the latest release bundle for your machine, checks its sha256 and runs its installer. Run it again to upgrade, or with `--uninstall` to remove Klammr; `KLAMMR_VERSION` picks a specific release. Every release is installed and uninstalled this way on Linux, macOS and Windows by CI.

### Changed
- Renamed to **Klammr** (formerly Kursor), with a new mark: a text cursor held in a pair of brackets. Breaking: the app, the `klammr` command, the install and data folders (`~/.local/opt/klammr`, `~/.config/Klammr`, `~/.klammr`), the `klammr://` URL scheme, the extension ID (`klammr.klammr`) and every command, setting and context key (`kursor.*` → `klammr.*`) change. Klammr installs next to an existing Kursor with a fresh profile; remove Kursor with its own uninstaller.
- The source and releases move to github.com/klammr/klammr and the website to klammr.github.io/klammr; the Help menu links, the Settings About tab and the package metadata point there. Kursor 0.1.x stays at github.com/brucegrootgames/kursor.
- Klammr Dark is rebuilt from the brand palette by `scripts/build-theme.mjs`: ink window, surface panels, violet accent, orchid cursor, Keep / Undo / Warn for diffs and git status, and Klammr's own syntax colours instead of VS Code's Dark+.
- Klammr's own workbench look by default: VS Code's Modern UI with floating rounded panels, the Inter-first UI font, layout toggles in the title bar, smooth cursor blinking and caret animation, no minimap. New installs also fold the menu bar into one button.
- Chat and Settings follow the brand: brand UI font, an inset composer with a single focus ring and the accent-gradient send button, a cursor-bar streaming caret, approval cards in amber, Klammr syntax colours in code blocks, no drop shadow on the logo. In the side bar the native title shows the chat title and the duplicate header is gone; the tab strip appears only with several chats.
- Release bundles are named after the Klammr version (`Klammr-linux-x64-0.2.0.tar.gz`) instead of the VSCodium version inside them.

### Fixed
- On a new profile the secondary side bar opened VS Code's disabled Chat container ("Drag a view here to display") instead of the Klammr chat.
- After installing from a bundle, the installer's closing hints pointed at `product/install.sh` and `product/uninstall.sh`, which a bundle does not have; they now show the one-line commands.
- The website said the uninstaller's `--purge` deletes settings; `--yes` does, `--purge` deletes the download cache.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- Brand identity: new Kursor mark (text cursor + code bracket), wordmark, palette and type guide (`docs/BRAND.md`); applied to app icons, the chat empty state, the Settings About tab, the Kursor Dark accent colours, the editor watermark, and the website (fonts, favicons, social card, Brand section).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-03

First public release.

### Added
- Agent chat in the secondary side bar with Agent / Ask / Plan modes, streaming replies, tool rows, @-mentions (files, folders, code, problems, terminal, git, web, rules), slash commands, image attachments, model and effort picker, context meter, queued messages and send-now.
- Permission cards (Run / Skip / Always allow), question cards and plan cards (Build / Reject) backed by Claude Code's permission system.
- Agent edit review: Keep / Undo / Review per file and per hunk, review bar, inline decorations, status-bar counter, checkpoint restore.
- Ctrl+K inline edit with in-place vertical diff and Accept / Reject CodeLens; quick question, whole-file edit, send to chat; Apply / Insert / Run from chat code blocks.
- Tab ghost-text completions with debounce, snooze and per-language opt-out.
- Terminal Ctrl+K command generation, commit-message generation, Fix in Chat / Add to Chat / Explain code actions, terminal context menu actions.
- Cursor rules support: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, User Rules.
- Kursor Settings panel (Ctrl+Shift+J), chat history and Markdown export.
- IDE bridge so a `claude` started in the integrated terminal sees the editor (selection, diagnostics, diffs).
- Cross-platform installer (`product/install.mjs` with `install.sh` / `install.cmd` bootstraps) that downloads, verifies and rebrands VSCodium 1.135.06055 for Linux, macOS and Windows; release bundles via `npm run bundle` and GitHub Actions.
- Omarchy integration on Linux: theme hook, launcher entry, optional SUPER+SHIFT+K binding and default-editor hookup.
- "Kursor Dark" color theme.

### Fixed
- Installer and bundle builder use Windows' built-in `tar.exe` (bsdtar) instead of a GNU tar found on PATH, which misread `C:\` paths and cannot handle zip archives.
